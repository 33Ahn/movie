# movie-theater-api
Movie Theater Project for Bootcamp Week 7 Day 5

### Goal
Be able to create an express server app demonstrating knowledge of Express and RESTful APIs:

1. CRUD Routing
2. Testing with Postman
3. Express Routers
4. Server-Side Validation

### Checklists

1. Create your Express Server
2. Create your Express Routers
3. User Router can get all users from the database using the endpoint “/users”
4. User Router can get one user from the database using an endpoint such as “/users/1” or “/users/2”
5. User Router can get all the shows watched by a user using an endpoint such as “/users/2/shows”, or “/users/8/shows”
6. User Router can update and add a show if a user has watched it using an endpoint such as “/users/2/shows/9” or “/users/1/shows/2”
7. Show Router can get all shows from the database using the endpoint “/shows”
8. Show Router can get one show from the database using an endpoint such as “/shows/2” or “/shows/5”
9. Show Router can get shows of a specific genre using an endpoint such as “/shows/genres/Comedy“ or “/shows/genres/Drama”
10. Show Router can update a rating on a specific show using an endpoint such as “/shows/4/watched” or “/shows/9/watched”
11. Show Router can update the status on a specific show from “canceled” to “on-going” or vice versa using an endpoint such as “/shows/3/updates” or “/shows/9/updates”
12. Show Router can delete a show
13. Include Server-Side Validation when updating the “status” of a show. The “status” field cannot be empty and must be between 5 and 25 characters. (OPTIONAL)
14. Include Server-Side Validation when updating the “rating” of a show. The “rating” field cannot be empty.  (OPTIONAL)
